## Introduction
Quiche is a python implementation of egraphs based on
[egraphs-good (egg)](https://egraphs-good.github.io/).

For usage examples, check out the demo code in `demo/egraphs_demo.py`,
as well as the `tests` directory: `test_asts.py`, `test_egraph.py`, and
`prop_test.py`!

Additional documentation coming soon!


## Installation:

Currently, Quiche works with python 3.7-3.10.

We recommend using venv.
See [the Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
for venv setup. E.g., in Bash, you can do the following to set up a python 3.7
virtual environment:

    $ python3.7 -m venv .

Activate your virtual environment, e.g. in Bash:

    $ source ./bin/activate

And when you're finished you can deactivate it as well:

    $ deactivate


To install Quiche, clone this repo and use pip (from the top-level `quiche` directory):

    $ pip install .

If you want to generate SVG images of `QuicheTree`s or `EGraphs` you should
also install `graphviz`:

    $ pip install graphviz


## Running Tests
To run the tests (from the top-level `quiche` directory):

  1. Install testing dependencies from requirements.txt:

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

  2. Run tests (from top-level `quiche` directory):

    $ pytest
